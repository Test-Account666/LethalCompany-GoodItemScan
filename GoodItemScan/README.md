# Good Item Scan Mod

Since everyone likes mods that replace the vanilla scan (Right?), I decided to try my own :)

This mod increases the maximum amount of scannable ScanNodes to <= 666.

It completely replaces the vanilla scan behavior, so it should (theoretically) improve performance.

It should also be more reliable than the vanilla scan.

## Known Issues

- Scanning one item without "Always Re-Scan" enabled, can make total value appear
